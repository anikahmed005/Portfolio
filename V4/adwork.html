                This required me to utilize a wide variety of research methodology ranging from <span id="keywords">

                The Online Surveys were conducted via google forms. The questions that I had curated dealt with the

                creative process. whether it's building a portfolio or just finding that one job.
                <br>
                Aside from those kind of questions, I also focused upon the features that Adwork might consider having
                and asking the participants how they feel about specific features to gauge interest.
                <br>
                The survey was then distributed to student's from a wide variety of disciplines that may utilize this
                app such as <span id="keywords">communications technology, fashion design, graphic design &
                    architecture</span>.

            <p id="process">
                After seeing the results of my research methods, I began to start the design process for the project.
                For this specific project I decided start off step by step starting with;
                <div id="steps">
                    <li>
                        <h2>Moodboard:</h2> Creating a moodboard revolves around finding inspiration from other
                        applications in terms of layout/features, the typefaces and color schemes that I utilized.This
                        provided me with insight that I would utilize when coming up with the paper prototype and the
                        eventual digital prototype.

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h2>User Flow Chart:</h2> Creating a user flow chart is something that is integral to do before
                        I sketched out my design ideas as it's supposed to to give me a <span
                            id="keywords">'pathway'</span> to adhere to, that
                        would make sense for the users that will use it and shape the 'outline' of my ideas as a whole.
                        It allowed me to refocus my design so that it would make sense to users, and not look like a
                        jumbled mess.
                        <figure>

                    <li>
                        <h2>Sketches/Paper Prototype:</h2> After doing both the moodboard and flow chart, I began to
                        draw out my design
                        ideas in order to grasp the direction that I intend to follow. I did about <span id="keywords">3
                            iterations</span> of my sketches before I choose which one would be used as a paper
                        prototype in order for me to begin a final digial prototype.

            <p id="conclusion">
                Using all of my research and the foundation that I had set for the project with the data that I had
                collected from the in-person interviews, online surveys, alongside the design decisions I made based
                upon the paper prototype, moodboard, & flow chart, I've made a strong product for both students and
                mentors. That being said I do believe that there should <span id="keywords">be more iterations and
                testing regarding the product itself that need to be expanded upon</span>.

            <p id="conclusion">
                Furthermore to explain to supposed stakeholders (those who may be invested in the project outside of my primary targeted demographic i.e students/experienced veterns) as to why AdWork would be beenficial to fund, invest time towards, and support I'd state that <span id="keywords">AdWork would be beneficial in educating a group of people as a community, allow hiring departments of agencies use the app to scout/educate local talent, build a relationship with budding creatives as a way to develop your brand</span>. This goes without to say that the monetary benefits of using the app to request work to be done for a nominal fee as opposed to freelancer rates.

            <p id="conclusion">
                All in all AdWork is a great application in concept and I've thorooughly enjoyed the bulk of the work as it has introduced me to the world of user experience design as a whole. Thank you for your attention to my first case study.
